### Key Concepts

- **Auditors**: Analyze routes for specific security aspects and return scores
- **Routes**: Abstract route representations that work across frameworks
- **Exporters**: Generate reports in various formats (HTML, JSON)
- **Parsers**: Extract information from code using AST analysis

## Making Changes

### Before You Start

1. **Check existing issues**: Look for related issues or feature requests
2. **Create an issue**: Discuss major changes before implementing
3. **Create a branch**: Use descriptive branch names
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/add-csrf-auditor
   git checkout -b fix/policy-detection-bug
   git checkout -b docs/improve-installation-guide
   ```

### Types of Contributions

#### Bug Fixes

- **Small fixes**: Can be submitted directly as PRs
- **Complex bugs**: Create an issue first to discuss the approach
- **Include tests**: Demonstrate the bug and verify the fix
- **Update documentation**: If behavior changes

#### New Features

- **Create an issue**: Discuss the feature before implementation
- **Follow existing patterns**: Use similar implementations as references
- **Add comprehensive tests**: Cover all scenarios and edge cases
- **Update documentation**: Add usage examples and API docs

#### Documentation Improvements

- **Fix typos and errors**: Small changes can be submitted directly
- **Add examples**: Real-world usage examples are always welcome
- **Improve clarity**: Make complex concepts easier to understand
- **Add translations**: Help make docs accessible to more users

#### Performance Improvements

- **Benchmark before/after**: Demonstrate performance gains
- **Maintain compatibility**: Don't break existing APIs
- **Add tests**: Ensure functionality remains correct
- **Document changes**: Explain what was optimized and why

## Code Style

### PHP Standards

We follow **PSR-12** coding standards with some additional rules:

### Naming Conventions

- **Classes**: `PascalCase` (e.g., `PolicyAuditor`)
- **Methods**: `camelCase` (e.g., `handleRoute`)
- **Variables**: `camelCase` (e.g., `$routeScore`)
- **Constants**: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `MAX_SCORE`)

### Documentation Standards

- **DocBlocks**: Required for all public methods
- **Type hints**: Use for all parameters and return types
- **Comments**: Explain complex logic, not obvious code
