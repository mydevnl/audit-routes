# Version Upgrade Guide

*This guide will be expanded with specific upgrade instructions as new versions are released. Current focus is on establishing clear versioning practices and communication standards.*

## Versioning Strategy

Audit Routes follows [Semantic Versioning (semver.org)](https://semver.org/) to provide predictable and reliable version management:

- **MAJOR** (1.0.0 → 2.0.0): Breaking changes that require code modifications
- **MINOR** (1.0.0 → 1.1.0): New features with backward compatibility
- **PATCH** (1.0.1 → 1.0.2): Bug fixes and improvements

### Contributing to Version Planning

Help shape future versions:
- **Feature requests**: Suggest new functionality
- **Breaking change feedback**: Discuss proposed changes
- **Beta testing**: Early testing of major releases
