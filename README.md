# Audit Routes

This PHP Package provides a streamlined approach to gaining insights into the security and protection of your application's routes. In just a few seconds, you can assess critical aspects such as:

- **Test Coverage:** Comprehensive tests cover all routes to ensure reliability
- **Authentication:** Routes requiring authentication are clearly identified
- **Scoped Bindings:** Nested route models are scoped to maintain data integrity
- **Permissions:** Permission or policy checks enforce access control
- **Middleware:** Essential middleware is applied for security and request handling

## Installation

You can install the package via Composer:

```bash
composer require mydevnl/audit-routes --dev
```

Optionally publish the configuration file:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=audit-routes-config
```

## Quick Start

Get your first audit running in seconds:

```bash
# Run a basic security audit
php artisan route:audit -vv

# Generate a detailed HTML report
php artisan route:audit-report

# Check authentication coverage
php artisan route:audit-auth -vv
```

For programmatic usage:

```php
use MyDev\AuditRoutes\AuditRoutes;
use MyDev\AuditRoutes\Auditors\PolicyAuditor;
use MyDev\AuditRoutes\Auditors\MiddlewareAuditor;

$result = AuditRoutes::for($router->getRoutes())
    ->setBenchmark(50)
    ->run([
        PolicyAuditor::make()->setWeight(25),
        MiddlewareAuditor::make(['auth'])->setWeight(20),
    ]);
```

## How It Works

Audit Routes uses a **scoring system** to evaluate route security:

- **Built-in Auditors**: PolicyAuditor, MiddlewareAuditor, PhpUnitAuditor, and more
- **Configurable Weights**: Customize importance of different security aspects
- **Benchmark System**: Set minimum scores for compliance (routes below benchmark are flagged)
- **Multiple Outputs**: Console, HTML reports, JSON exports for different workflows

Learn more about the [Architecture](docs/reference/architecture/overview.md) and [Auditor System](docs/reference/architecture/auditor-system.md).

## Available Commands

The package provides several built-in commands to help you get started quickly:

- **`route:audit`** - Comprehensive route security analysis
- **`route:audit-report`** - Generate detailed HTML audit reports
- **`route:audit-test-coverage`** - Analyze test coverage for routes
- **`route:audit-auth`** - Focus on authentication middleware analysis

For detailed usage examples and command-line options, see the [Basic Usage Guide](docs/guides/basic-usage.md#command-line-options).

### Quick Reference

```bash
# Basic audit with detailed output
php artisan route:audit -vv

# High security standards
php artisan route:audit --benchmark 75 -vv

# Generate HTML report
php artisan route:audit-report

# Check authentication coverage
php artisan route:audit-auth -vv

# Verify test coverage
php artisan route:audit-test-coverage --benchmark 1 -vv

# Export results for CI/CD
php artisan route:audit --benchmark 50 --export json --filename security-audit.json
```

## Testing Integration

The package includes PHPUnit assertions for integrating route security checks directly into your test suite. Use the `AssertsAuditRoutes` trait to enforce security standards as part of your CI/CD pipeline.

See the [Testing Guide](docs/guides/testing.md) for comprehensive examples and best practices.

## Troubleshooting

**Common issues:**
- **No routes found?** Ensure your Laravel application has defined routes and clear route cache: `php artisan route:clear`
- **Permission errors?** Check that `storage/exports/audit-routes/` is writable: `chmod -R 775 storage/`
- **Configuration issues?** Verify your `config/audit-routes.php` settings match your project structure
